## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is supposed to be the back-end for the Sharey application, an API that is in charge of saving images, tagging them, adding an expiration time, comments, etc. The purpose of this application is for people to easily make their own front-ends for taggable image boards, basically.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
